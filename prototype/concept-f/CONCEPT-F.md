# CONCEPT F: Gunther Werks Miami home page (25 Oct 2026)

**Why F exists.** Alex scored v1 at D 6.5/10 and E 7/10. The binding direction is to take **E's structure**, add **D's dark-cove boldness**, and rebuild **section 02 as one real slider at a constant scale**.
- D read as a poster: giant names, repeated figures and the dark panel, and the programs were separate scenes that couldn't be compared. Prestige was missing.
- E sprawled into a catalogue: a slogan screen, a long news strip, a provenance grid, a commission journey and events.

Cut repeats, decorative screens and duplicated proof. Never cut facts a buyer needs. Keep one strong example per job.

The v1 snapshots (do not edit) are `prototype/_archive/concept-d_v1_2026-10-25` and `concept-e_v1_2026-10-25`. The videos are in `_archive/video/`.

## The idea in one line
**Every Gunther Werks is the same 993, remastered. Hold the silhouette still and let the eye find what the atelier changed.** The page is a precise route for a collector:

> who we are (Gunther Werks Miami, by Prestige Imports) → the programs, compared on one constant base → how they're made → one moment of speed → one car available now → the latest news → talk to Javier.

## Target length
E v1 was 22,600 px at 1920×1080. **F is no more than about 13,500 px at 1920×1080** (about 12–13 screens including pins). Each section is one full screen unless it truly needs more.

## Sections

### 0. Header (fixed, always visible)
- Left: GW wordmark plus `MIAMI · PRESTIGE IMPORTS`.
- Nav: Programs · Atelier · Provenance · News · Miami.
- Right: (305) 783-6493 and Enquire.
- Lighter than D: one row, no needle and no mono indices.
- Contrast flips per section (light/dark), using E's mechanism.

### 1. Hero: dark cove (D's boldness)
- **Image:** a GW dark-cove still with real negative space for the type, e.g. `research/corp/assets/hero/02-f26-profile-warm-cove_4800x2700.jpg` (or the Thermal red-haze cove if the composition is stronger). Set `object-position` deliberately and keep the car small enough to breathe.
- **H1:** "Gunther Werks Miami".
- **Line:** "The official Gunther Werks dealer in Miami — Prestige Imports, North Miami Beach."
- **Actions:** two slim outline buttons, "Book a private viewing" and "Explore the programs".
- **Motion:** slow scroll-linked push-in / parallax of the photo, and a masked line reveal of the H1 on load.

### 2. House Lights: the program slider (THE section, rebuild from zero)
One chapter, one screen, **light**. The studio lights come up as you arrive: a scroll-linked dark→bright white-seamless cove that is pinned briefly for the light-up only. After that it is a normal screen with a real slider. **Scroll is never hijacked to step through the programs.**

- **One car at a time, large:** about 60–65% of the content width at 1440. Use GW's true-alpha **Profile L** cutouts.
- **Constant base:** normalise every cutout so the **wheelbase is the same length in px and the tyres sit on the same floor line**. Measure the wheel centres per file and store the offsets in a small data table. Bounding-box scaling is wrong, because the F-26 nose and wing change the bbox.
- **Changing program:** the body stays registered and the car crossfades **in place**, so the eye sees the nose, wing, intakes and wheels change on the same silhouette. That is the brief's idea made literal. There is a soft floor reflection. **No sliding carousel.**
- **Switcher:** a compact row of F-26 · Turbo · GWR · GWX with production counts (26 · 75 · 40 · By invitation).
  - Click/tap, arrow keys, and swipe/drag on touch.
  - A designed hover with an idea: hovering a name lays that program's silhouette over the current car as a fine **outline ghost**, registered on the same base, so you see the difference before you commit.
- **Beside the car:** the program name at a **modest** size (no giant poster names), one GW line, and **3–4 concrete sourced differences**.
  - Take them from `research/corp/GUNTHER_WERKS_CI.md` and D's program plates (`_archive/concept-d_v1_2026-10-25/index.html`).
  - Examples: F-26 twin-turbo 4.0 L, about 1,000 hp (GW release 15 Aug 2025), slantnose, swan-neck wing, 26 examples; GWR naturally aspirated, 9,000 rpm, 40 examples.
  - No repeated spec rows, no index numbers.
- **Optional, if clean:** 2–3 fine leader-line callouts on the car marking what changed for that program (nose, wing, intakes). They are placed per program on the registered silhouette and fade with the car.
- **Action per program:** "Enquire with Javier about the F-26 →", which preselects the program in the Miami form.
- **Special editions:** one line under the switcher, "Special editions: GXR-EVO 15 · Brundle Edition 5 · Thermal Edition 5 · Project End Game 1 of 1". Each name puts that car on the same stage (Profile L cutouts exist for all four). No cards.
- **Assets:** `research/corp/assets/cutouts/*-profile-l-*`.
  - The Turbo Profile L exists only at 1400 px (`turbo-profile-l-orange_1400x466.png`). Accept it and note the retina softness in the report. Never upscale with AI.
  - Export webp at 2400 and 1200 widths where the source allows.

### 3. Atelier: one strong example of craft
- **Statement:** "Reengineered and remastered."
- **Three sourced facts:** more than 90% made in-house · 4.0 L flat-six developed with Rothsport Racing · carbon fibre made in Huntington Beach.
- **Images:** one large craft image plus one or two overlapping smaller ones, with parallax at different speeds. Use the macro and craft images E/D already used.
- The X-pattern key may appear as one image with its line "The company key was designed in an 'X' pattern — a symbol of every door that closed." (that is GW's own line, sourced).
- **Cut:** the history timeline, the separate commission journey 01–06, and the build steps.

### 4. Goodwood: one moment of speed
- Reuse E's canvas scrub of the F-26 at Goodwood (frames already exist in E).
- Make the pin **shorter** than in E: one caption with its timestamp, plus "1,000 hp" sourced to the 15 Aug 2025 release.
- Rule from earlier fixes: a caption never lingers under the header.

### 5. Provenance Succession: one car
- One car available now (choose the strongest photo of Phoenix / Rubystone / Blue Phoenix), large.
- Name, body/colour, "Factory re-validated", and "Ask about Provenance Succession →".
- One line names the other two as text links. No grid.
- No prices and no availability claims beyond GW's own wording.

### 6. News: three items
- The three most recent dated GW items, as cards: Brundle Edition 21 Oct 2026 · GXR-EVO at The Quail 14 Aug 2026 · Goodwood July 2026.
- Plus "All news ↗" to guntherwerks.com.
- No horizontal strip.

### 7. Miami: talk to Javier
- **Prestige Imports:** 15050 Biscayne Blvd, North Miami Beach, FL 33181 · Javier Roque · (305) 783-6493 · Javier@PrestigeImports.com.
- **Form:** intent chips (Discuss a commission · Provenance Succession · Private viewing), program preselected from §2, then name / email / phone / message.
- All states are designed: empty, focus, error and sent. It is prototype-only, with `preventDefault`.
- GW's line "We don't sell cars. We deliver dreams." may appear **small**, as an attributed quote near the form. It is never a full screen.
- No fake Miami imagery.

### 8. Footer
Structured columns, the Prestige line, and the Porsche non-affiliation line. Reuse E's footer.

## UI language
- **Base:** E's "Glass & Key" (Instrument Sans ~88% width; Bebas Neue for figures only; slim outline buttons, no fat pills).
- **Glass** only where a panel sits over imagery, with the `prefers-reduced-transparency` fallback.
- **The light/dark rhythm:** hero dark → House Lights light → atelier dark → Goodwood dark (film) → provenance light → news dark → Miami light/dark → footer dark.
- **No stage-light cones.** Light is haze, feathered, with grain.

## Motion (rich, authored, never decorative)
- Persistent nav.
- Hero: push-in and parallax.
- House Lights: the lights-up scrub, the registered crossfade, and the ghost hover.
- Atelier: overlap parallax.
- Goodwood: the scrub that carries information.
- Masked line reveals on statements.
- Hovers with an idea on every link and card.
- Every motion has a designed `prefers-reduced-motion` state.

## Mobile (desktop is the master)
- The same components, re-stacked.
- House Lights: the car is full-width, with the switcher in the thumb zone; swipe changes the program and the ghost-outline appears on press.
- One pin per page at most, no parallax, targets ≥44 px.

## Done means
- QA at 1920/1440/1024/768/390/360 with real wheel scrolling: 0 horizontal overflow, 0 console errors, and contrast measured on the composited render.
- House Lights verified for all 8 cars: the floor line and wheelbase are identical (measure them, report px).
- Page height reported at 1920×1080.
